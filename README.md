# Azure-JIT-Access-Console

Offer time-bound privileged access requests with approvals, traceability, and Bastion-mediated sessions.

## Example synopsis

An engineer's time-bounded access request is checked for tenant, target sensitivity, explicit approval, fresh evidence, and secretless identity before PIM/Bastion workflow adapters execute.

## Real-world scenario

Production administrators currently retain standing VM access because emergency elevation is too slow. The console creates an auditable request path for temporary access and removes the incentive to keep permanent privileged assignments.

## Architecture

A minimal web/API portal authenticates through Entra ID, records requests, and invokes Logic Apps approval. Approved requests activate PIM-eligible roles or scoped access, issue Bastion connection instructions, and automatically remove access on expiry.

Primary services: `Entra PIM`, `Bastion`, `Logic Apps`, `Key Vault`, `Azure Monitor`.

This repository implements the first production-oriented vertical slice: a
fail-closed, adapter-neutral control plane that validates tenant scope,
freshness, approvals, secretless identity, private access, and the exact
project action before producing a deterministic execution plan. Azure adapters
consume that plan; they are deliberately outside the local simulator so local
tests cannot claim a live cloud change occurred.

## Quickstart

Requirements: Python 3.11+ and Git. No Azure credentials are required.

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
python3 src/control_plane.py --request examples/approved-request.json
```

The command emits canonical JSON with a stable idempotency key. The denied
fixture exits with status 2 and explains the failed invariants.

## Security boundaries

- Managed identity or workload identity only; embedded credentials are denied.
- Public network access and stale evidence are denied.
- Production and break-glass targets require explicit approval.
- The IaC entry point is opt-in and defaults to deploying nothing.
- Evidence output contains identifiers and decisions, never credential values.

## Verification and limitations

Local validation covers 13 tests, deterministic replay, JSON parsing, Python
compilation, ignore hygiene, and Bicep compilation when a compiler is present.
It does **not** prove Azure deployment, service licensing, quota, data-plane
permissions, provider/API availability, cloud failover, load, cost, or teardown.
